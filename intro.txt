Hello, my name is Shreya Amin, a transfer student at NJIT, majoring in architecture. I recently relocated to the United States from Gujarat, India, where I was born and raised. After completing high school and five semesters in a Bachelor of Interior Design program, I transitioned to a Bachelor of Architecture to pursue my lifelong dream of becoming an architect.
